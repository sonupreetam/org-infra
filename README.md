# ⚙️ CI/CD Reusable Workflows

This repository centrally manages configuration files, templates, and standardized CI/CD workflows for the organization.
Its purpose is to ensure **security, consistency, and reusability** across all repositories by defining common settings and automation processes once.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The primary goal is to provide **pre-vetted, security-hardened pipeline steps** for common tasks, such as environment deployment, lint checks, dependency review, vulnerability scans, tests coverage, and more.

Specifically, this repository includes:

* [Reusable Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/reuse-automations/reuse-workflows) for common tasks
* Container image build, publish, sign, and promotion pipelines with supply chain security
* Compliance evaluation with attestation-based policy checks
* Templates to consume reusable workflows in org repositories
* Templates for PRs and Issues creation
* Configuration files for lint checks
* Synchronization script integrated with [peribolos](https://github.com/complytime/.github/blob/main/peribolos.yaml) to periodically check consistence among repositories

## Style Guides

* Reusable workflows are prefixed by `reusable_` and should have a clear, descriptive name reflecting its function.
* Reusable workflows are generic enough to be consumed by any repository within the organization.
* Regular workflows consuming reusable workflows are prefixed by `ci_`.
* Workflows must ensure the Principle of Least Privilege.
* Write permissions must be avoided. When necessary, they are defined in the minimal possible scope.
* Prefer defining explicit permissions per Job.
* PRs must pass all CI jobs.

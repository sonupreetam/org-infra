# org-infra

CI/CD infrastructure hub for ComplyTime. Syncs reusable workflows, lint configs, templates, and AI tooling to all org repositories via `sync-config.yml`.

## Structure

.opencode/commands/      # Project-specific AI commands (review-pr.md)
sync-config.yml          # Defines which files sync to org repos — check before modifying any config
.specify/memory/constitution.md  # All coding standards and governance (single source of truth)
Makefile                 # Build/test/lint automation
```

## Commands

```bash
make lint            # yamllint + ruff (all linters)
make test            # pytest -v
make sync-dry-run    # Preview file sync to org repos
make clean           # Remove __pycache__ and .pyc
```

## Council Review (AI-assisted PR review)

Comment-triggered workflow chain for AI code review using OpenCode on Vertex AI,
with Divisor persona discovery from the reviewed repo. Invoked by posting
`/council-review` as a PR comment. Only org members can invoke.

### Workflow chain

```text
ci_council_review_collect.yml  (issue_comment: /council-review)  [synced]
  ├── Gate: only PR comments starting with /council-review
  ├── Gate: skip drafts, dependabot PRs
  ├── Gate: verify commenter is an org member (notice reply if not)
  ├── Collect diff: gh pr diff → pr-diff.patch
  ├── Build metadata: pr-meta.json
  └── Upload artifact (1-day retention)
         │
         ▼  workflow_run / workflow_dispatch
ci_council_review.yml  (consumer)  [synced]
  └── Calls reusable_council_review.yml@main (org-infra only)
         │
         ▼  workflow_call
reusable_council_review.yml  [NOT synced — org-infra only]
  ├── Harden runner (egress blocked, allowlist only)
  ├── Cooldown check (5-minute minimum between reviews)
  ├── WIF auth → Vertex AI
  ├── council-review-action (composite, SHA-pinned, from unbound-force)
  ├── Clean up previous bot comments
  ├── Post review summary
  └── Post inline comments on diff lines
```

### Required secrets

| Secret | Scope | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` | Org-level | WIF provider for Vertex AI auth |
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | Org-level | GCP project containing Vertex AI |
| `ORG_CHECK_TOKEN` | Optional | PAT with `org:read` for private membership checks (falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` for public-only) |

### Sync and rollout

Consumer workflows (`ci_council_review_collect.yml`, `ci_council_review.yml`) sync
to downstream repos via `sync-config.yml`. The reusable workflow stays in org-infra
and is called cross-repo. See `sync-config.yml` for current `exclude_repos` list.

Rollout is staged: all downstream repos are excluded until the composite action SHA
points to a merged `main` commit and security hardening (#429) / cost controls (#430)
are in place.

### Related issues

- Security hardening: #429
- Token consumption controls: #430
- `continue-on-error` removal: #440
- Composite action: `unbound-force/unbound-force` → `council-review-action/`

See `docs/COUNCIL_REVIEW.md` for the full operational guide.

## Constraints

- **Sync impact**: Config files (`.golangci.yml`, `.yamllint.yml`, `ruff.toml`, `.mega-linter.yml`, `commitlint.config.js`) and workflows (`ci_*`, `reusable_*`) sync to all org repos. Check `sync-config.yml` before modifying to understand downstream impact.
- **Workflow naming**: Reusable workflows MUST use `reusable_` prefix, consumer workflows `ci_` prefix.
- **Python**: Lint with `ruff` (`ruff.toml`). No `go.mod` — this repo is Python + YAML, not Go (Go configs are sync templates for other repos).
- **YAML**: Lint with `yamllint` (`.yamllint.yml`). Line length follows yamllint config, not the 99-char code rule.
- **Standards**: All coding standards are in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Do not duplicate them.
- **AI tooling**: Setup, commands, and skill creation documented in `docs/AI_TOOLING.md`.

## Commits

All commits MUST use Conventional Commits, the `-s` flag (Signed-off-by), and include an `Assisted-by` trailer:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: add feature X

Description of changes.

Assisted-by: OpenCode (model-name)"
```

Replace `model-name` with the actual model identifier (e.g., `claude-opus-4-6`).

## Recent Changes
- 004-standardize-ai-tooling: Added YAML (GitHub Actions syntax), Markdown, Python 3.x (sync scripts only) + OpenCode (agent), OpenSpec/SpecKit (spec frameworks — plugin-managed), `gh` CLI (PR review command), GitPython + PyYAML + requests (sync script — existing)
- 006-robust-dependabot-approval: Added Bash (shell scripts in GitHub Actions `run:` blocks), YAML (GitHub Actions workflow syntax) + GitHub Actions platform, `gh` CLI (pre-installed on runners), `jq` (pre-installed on runners), `curl` (pre-installed on runners), `actions/dependency-review-action@v4.9.0`, `peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@v5.0.0`, `actions/github-script@v8.0.0`, `actions/checkout@v6.0.2`, `tj-actions/changed-files@v47.0.5`
- 284-org-member-image-push: Extended `reusable_publish_ghcr.yml` with unprotected ref publishing (org membership verification, dev-prefixed tag isolation, configurable attestation policy). Added `docker/login-action@v4.2.0`, `docker/setup-qemu-action@v4.0.0`, `docker/setup-buildx-action@v4.1.0`, `docker/build-push-action@v7.2.0`, `docker/metadata-action@v6.1.0`, `actions/attest-build-provenance@v4.1.0`, `anchore/sbom-action@v0.24.0`, `actions/attest@v4.1.0`, `sigstore/cosign-installer@v4.1.2`
- 306-publish-complypack-ampel-bp: Added `reusable_publish_complypack.yml` (pack and push complypack OCI artifacts to GHCR with SLSA provenance and SBOM attestation) and `ci_publish_complypack.yml` (dual-registry: GHCR on push, Quay on release). Renamed `resuable_publish_quay.yml` to `reusable_publish_quay.yml` (typo fix). Uses `complypack` CLI via `go install`, `oras-project/setup-oras`, `imjasonh/setup-crane`.
- go-toolchain-patch-automation: Added `ci_renovate.yml` (centralized self-hosted Renovate runner for Go version patch updates). Uses `renovatebot/github-action@v46.1.16` with a dedicated GitHub App (`complytime-renovate[bot]`, `contents:write` + `pull-requests:write`). Shared preset (`go-toolchain-patches.json`) restricts to Go version patch updates only (matches `go` and `toolchain` directives via `matchDepNames`). Global config (`renovate-config.js`) autodiscovers org repos via `globalExtends`.
